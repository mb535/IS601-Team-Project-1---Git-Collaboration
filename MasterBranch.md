    The "default" branch name in git is called master. As you start making commits the master branch points to the last commit
    you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically.
   
   The “master” branch in Git is not a special branch. It is exactly like any other branch. The only reason nearly every repository has one is that the git init command creates it by default and most people don’t bother to change it.
