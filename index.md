#Introduction:

Docker created the industry standard for containers, which are self contained units of software packages that contain the application code and all related dependencies. Packaging and distributing as a package ensures that the code runs and functions reliably and efficiently across different environments.  The container is standalone  and contains everything required for the application to function effectively.

The use of containers eliminates the typical inefficiencies of distributing otherwise where the application code and it's required dependencies are installed separately, often by different teams or individuals, with no apparent connection. As the code moves through the test environment, it must be "setup" and configured repeatedly at each step. This is very time consuming, and has proven to be prone to mistakes and complications.

Use of Git, along with Docker and automated testing enables the software design principle of Continuous Integration. 

Git, a distributed version control system, enables developers to collaborate effectively and "check in" (commit) their code changes to the repository quickly, and on their own schedule. Commiting, though, is only the first step in "releasing" code to the users. Once the code is checked in, automated build scripts, it is built and tested automatically using scripts that react to the commits. This automated testing ensures the introduced changes pass all tests, meet standards and statisfy the functionality they are trying to solve. 

Using Git, Docker and automated testing to implement [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) enables companies to reduce time to market. New features can be introduced quickly, allowing not only quick reaction to customer demands, but also A/B testing, context labs, focus groups, etc. Developers can concetrate on developing new features and can "trust" the process to rollout their features effectively.
